</head>

<body>
<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security, Fall 2016</h1>
<h2>The Final Project</h2>
<h2 class="note">Absolute Deadline: Monday, December 12th at 11:59 PM</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We have covered a plethora of security topics in this class.  For the final project in the class, you will delve into a current security issue of your choice.</p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>My hope of this final project is that you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specialize in a current security issue of your choice</li>
<li>Gain hands-on experience in the field</li>
<li>Demonstrate technical knowledge</li>
<li>Communicate clearly to a community</li>
<li>Practice writing</li>
</ol>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>There is a very rich history of past projects in this class including <a href="https://www.andysayler.com/output/pdf/macswap-2600-article.pdf" target="_blank">Network Anonymity Through "MAC Swapping"</a></span> by Andrew Sayler (spring 2011); published in Volume 28, Issue 3 (Autumn 2011) of <span class="tite">2600: The Hacker Quarterly</span>.  An archive of past final projects is available at <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/archive/" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/archive/</a>.</p>


<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>For this final project, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a mentor</li>
<li>Write a paper</li>
<li>Provide your own supporting material that complements your paper</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Mentor</h2>
<p>The mentor can either me or someone in industry or academia.  The mentor cannot be a student in the class or a TA.  Should you choose someone other than me as your mentor, please note the person's name, title, and e-mail address on Abstract (first deliverable).</p>

<h2>The Paper</h2>
<p>The following are the guidelines for the paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required sections of paper:
<ul>
<li><span class="stress">Abstract</span></li>
<li><span class="stress">Introduction</span></li>
<li><span class="stress">To the Community</span> - Why did you choose this topic?  Why is this important to know? This section must be immediately after the Introduction.</li>
<li>One of the following:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="stress">Action Items</span> - In your own words, what do people need to do about the subject matter?</li>
		<li><span class="stress">Defenses</span> - Recommended if you work is attack-oriented.  In your own words, how do you defend against the subject matter?</li>
		<li><span class="stress">Applications</span> - Recommended if your work is more theoretical. In your own words, how can you apply your subject matter to the real world?</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="stress">Conclusion</span> or <span class="stress">Summary</span></li>
<li><span class="stress">References</span> - You must use at least five (5) high-quality references.  <span class="note">If you cite Wikipedia as a reference, it will result in a 25 point penalty!</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Supporting Material</h2>
<p>Along with your paper, you must produce a supporting material for your paper.  Options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Source code. This can be a demo, an exploit, a new security tool, an extension to an existing security tool or product, a script, a proof-of-concept, or an analysis of the source code.  You can use any programming language and there is no requirement for lines-of-code that you have to write.  Any source code that you write must be made public on GitHub</li>
<li>A code review of a malware or exploit.</li>
<li>A video. Must be at least five (5) minutes long.</li>
<li>A conference / academic project poster.  This is ideal especially if your work is more research oriented and of original work.  There are several posters from last year's Security class on the second floor of Halligan.  See this example: <a href="poster.jpg">poster.jpg</a>.  This was a project by a student, presented at the poster session at the 2015 Advanced Cyber Security Center (ACSC) Annual Conference.  While it is a good poster, it can be improved.  Too much text, the font is too small, more diagrams necessary, no insights on performance on poster.  BEWARE if your poster and work turn out to be amazing: it is very likely that you will be called to present your work and poster at a future event.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">IMPORTANT: This supporting material must be made publicly available.</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>
